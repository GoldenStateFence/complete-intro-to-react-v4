Welcome to the complete introduction web development v4. This is the fourth revision of this course and the most comprehensive one yet. While the previous three courses were all modifications of the same app, this one is brand new, re-written from the ground up. The previous versions of this coruse all have value and if one of them touches on a piece of technology that you want to use, you should definitely check that out (particularly v3.)

This course is unique as compared to other React introductions because this course attempts to teach you not only React but the ecosystem around React. When I was learning React myself, I found myself frustrated that it seemed like every tutorial started on step 14 and left out the steps 1-13 of how to set up a React project. React is nearly never used by itself so it's useful to know the tools you're using. I believe you as a developer should know how your tools works and what purpose they're serving. Many times have I taught courses similar to this one to hear people using tools and complaining about them because they don't actually know why they're using them, just that they're necessary. As such, in this course we show you how to build projects without any using tools at all and introduce the various tools, one at a time so you understand the actual problem being solved by the tool. Hopefully given the knowledge of the problem solved by the tool you'll embrace the tools despite their complexities due to the ease and power they offer you.
